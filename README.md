## Title
A fridge management app for every at-home cook!

## Project Description
Help people track their grocery inventory and reduce food waste. Simply scan your grocery receipts to save the items in-app. Receive expiration reminder notifications, build a grocery list based on your inventory, and more.

## Getting Started
1. Please have some receipt photos ready. These can be uploaded to your AVD in two ways:
    1. **(Recommended)** Drag and drop the photo from your machine directly into your AVD's Files app.
    2. Sign into Google on your AVD. Upload your photo to Google Photos from your machine. You will use Google Photos in the AVD to access your receipt.

2. In your `local.properties` file, you will need to add 2 API keys. Please contact me (alenaluo19@gmail.com) if you would like them.

3. After building and starting application, please allow notifications.
